## Simple React frontend built for the KTH Kista Course _Projects & Project Methods_
During this course electrical engineering students cooperated with computer science students in order to learn about and compare project methods used in IT projects. The electrical engineering students built a small hardware component, and the computer science group developed a small software system able to interact with the hardware. The focus was on studying literature on different project methods and using the development of the software and hardware system to try them out in a group setting with a hard deadline. The systems developed were to be kept very basic as most of the coursework should be spent on evaluating project methods.

__DISCLAIMER__: The coursework was carried out in Swedish. The final report found in this repository as well as the coursework presented in this README is all in Swedish.
### Final Report (Swedish)
:link: [_What is a good project methodology for small-scale IT projects?_](https://github.com/august-ronne/II1302-Projects-and-Project-Methods-2020-KTH-Course/blob/main/slutrapport.pdf "Read report")
### Key Course Concepts
* __IT project methods__
* __Agile project management__
* __Incremental development__
* __IT project roles__
* __Scrum framework__
* __Essential Unified Process for Software Development (EssUP)__
### Project Roles
The group consisted of five members, three students from electrical engineering and two studying computer science. The project roles that had to be filled were:
* Stakeholder representative
* Project architect
* Lead developer (software and hardware)
* System tester (software and hardware)
* Project manager
* Sustainability and ethics manager
* Working environment manager
Since the group only had five members, students had to rotate between certain roles to make sure all of the required work was carried out.
