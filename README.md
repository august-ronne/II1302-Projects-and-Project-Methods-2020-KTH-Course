## Simple React frontend built for the KTH Kista Course _Projects & Project Methods_
During this course electrical engineering students cooperated with computer science students in order to learn about and compare project methods used in IT projects. The electrical engineering students built a small hardware system, and the computer science group developed a small software system able to interact with the hardware. The focus was on studying literature on different project methods and using the development of the software and hardware system to try them out in a group setting with a hard deadline. The systems developed were to be kept very basic as most of the coursework should be spent on evaluating project methods.

__DISCLAIMER__: The coursework was carried out in Swedish. The final report found in this repository as well as the coursework presented in this README is all in Swedish.
